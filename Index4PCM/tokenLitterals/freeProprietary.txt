freepcb
a printed circuit board design program for microsoft windows. freepcb allows for up to 16 copper layers, both metric and english units, and export of designs in gerber format. boards can be partially or fully autorouted with the freerouting autorouter by using the fpcroute specctra dsn file translator.
unlike other free software alternatives, kicad provides for all design stages through the same interface: schematic capture, pcb layout, gerber generation/visualization, and library editing are all standard features. it also has a "3d view" feature for pcbs.it is available for all three major operating systems, and features a large selection of component libraries. migration tools (for transferring files from other eda packages) are also provided. the file format is plain text, and is well documented, which is a useful feature for content management systems.

verilator is the fastest free verilog hdl simulator. it compiles synthesizable verilog into cycle accurate c++ or systemc code following 2-state synthesis (zero delay) semantics. benchmarks reported on its website suggest it is several times faster than commercial event driven simulators such as modelsim, nc-verilog and vcs, while not quite as fast as commercial cycle accurate modeling tools such as carbon modelstudio and arc vtoc.

opposed bailout. barr will seek to limit policies that permit political interference in the economy in favor of the exercise of a free-market economic model. this would include: formally and clearly end the bailouts which promote private economic retrenchment and corporate work-outs; limiting powers of the government to place sustained federal pressure to increase mortgage lending, through freddie mac and fannie mae; amending or revoking the community reinvestment act; limiting the ability of the federal reserve to manipulate the currency for political purposes; ensuring enforcement of the sec regulations to insure solvency and transparency in the operation of major investment firms; permanently lowering tax rates and simplifying taxes to more effectively reinforce long-term plans for hiring, inventory and production; cutting environmental rules such as corporate average fuel economy standards on vehicles; initiating a detailed audit of federal rules, relaxing or eliminating any regulations for which costs outweigh benefits; reducing penalties on people for delayed tax payments and premature withdrawals from iras; ending nonessential federal spending, particularly frivolous special interest outlays; over the longer term, evaluate, plan, and implement for future federal liabilities and obligations—fdic bank guarantees, pension benefit guaranty corporation promises, social security and medicare liabilities, and more.
mccain is a strong proponent of free trade. he supports the north american free trade agreement (nafta), the existing general agreement on tariffs and trade, and u.s. participation in the world trade organization (wto). he opposes including labor and environmental conditions to trade agreements.
obama supports expanding trade only if the united states' trade partners place labor and environmental standards on their industries to "level the playing field" for american interests. if elected president, obama plans to renegotiate nafta to include stricter labor and environmental standards for canada and mexico. he has criticized the current agreement for not including such standards, and he also voted against and criticized the central america free trade agreement (cafta) for similar reasons.
baldwin would lead the us out of the north american and the central america free trade agreement. he would impose a revenue tariff.
barr's campaign site states that america "should encourage private involvement around the world, particularly through free trade. the most effective way to preserve peace is through an expanding free market, backed by a full range of cultural and other private relationships".
mckinney stresses enacting laws on us corporations to keep labor standards high at home and raise them abroad. she would repeal nafta (north american free trade agreement), cafta, the caribbean fta, and us-peru fta. she opposes the guest-worker program as riddled with abuses; supports justice for immigrant workers, and immigrant reform that includes amnesty and a path to legalization for undocumented people who have been living and working in the us for years.
believes in supplying better health care to america's veterans. supports freedom of choice, opposes compulsory vaccination.
at the beginning of his campaign, nader stated that he "will receive no money from commercial interests, no money from political action committees, only from individuals." he sees washington d.c. as "corporate-occupied territory, every department agency controlled by overwhelming presence of corporate lobbyists, corporate executives in high government positions." he supports public financing of campaigns and free tv and radio time for ballot qualified candidates.
wants to repeal the anti-union taft-hartley act. supports full employment and a living wage for all workers. supports justice for immigrant workers, and opposes guest-worker programs as riddled with abuses. opposes 'free trade' agreements and unelected international trade authorities (nafta, cafta, wto, gatt, 'fast track', etc.) that give corporate power and profit priority over labor rights and environmental protections; mckinney has voted against these agreements and advocates withdrawal. human rights protections and amnesty for undocumented immigrants, an end to raids, and tearing down the border wall; believes the flood of new immigrants is a result of economic policies and agreements (e.g., nafta) that impoverish people and drive them across borders, and that immigration should be addressed by fixing these policies while ensuring worker rights and right to organize. favors a strong safety net for middle- and low-income working people and families, with support for main street (small businesses and local economies) instead of wall street, and a massive transfer of federal funding from military contract and war spending to human needs.
"free and fair elections, not u.s. troops, are the best strategy for achieving peace and stability in pakistan." is the belief of cynthia mckinney in pakistan. she also opposes a united states war with pakistan.
says the free market needs to be the foundation of the united states' energy policy. supports drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge.
mckinney wants to leave alaska oil in the ground, declare the u.s. carbon-free and nuclear-free, and implement the kyoto treaty. she has voted no on scheduling permitting for new oil refineries and authorizing construction of new oil refineries. she has voted yes on keeping moratorium on drilling for oil offshore, raising cafe standards; incentives for alternative fuels, prohibiting oil drilling development in anwr, and starting implementation of kyoto protocol.
barr opposes any federal definition of marriage, whether by statute or constitutional amendment. he believes the states should be free to determine what constitutes marriage.
nader supports stem cell research. through his consumer project on technology, he seeks to ensure that research conducted with public money is freely available to the public, and not held back by corporate and university patents.
has often stated that it is wrong public education receives $38 billion annually while the pentagon receives $700 billion annually. she also believes reforms like no child left behind hurt the education system, and that free higher education and better primary education is what will improve school systems throughout the nation. she also voted yes on a substitute bill to lower student loan interest rates and increase black college and hispanic college quality and quantity. she voted yes on a bill for state-testing and voted no on bills to allow vouchers in the district of columbia, allowing vouchers in private schools and parochial schools, and no on a bill that would only give federal aid to schools that allowed school prayer.
