gpl
yes
a printed circuit board design program for microsoft windows. freepcb allows for up to 16 copper layers, both metric and english units, and export of designs in gerber format. boards can be partially or fully autorouted with the freerouting autorouter by using the fpcroute specctra dsn file translator.

suite of applications for schematic capture, pcb layout editing (with autorouting capability), gerber viewing, analog circuit simulation, verilog design, and gtk-based waveform viewing. microsoft windows-compatible binaries are no longer available but dan mcmahill maintains a build script for that os.

unlike other free software alternatives, kicad provides for all design stages through the same interface: schematic capture, pcb layout, gerber generation/visualization, and library editing are all standard features. it also has a "3d view" feature for pcbs.it is available for all three major operating systems, and features a large selection of component libraries. migration tools (for transferring files from other eda packages) are also provided. the file format is plain text, and is well documented, which is a useful feature for content management systems.

verilator

gpl

verilator is the fastest free verilog hdl simulator. it compiles synthesizable verilog into cycle accurate c++ or systemc code following 2-state synthesis (zero delay) semantics. benchmarks reported on its website suggest it is several times faster than commercial event driven simulators such as modelsim, nc-verilog and vcs, while not quite as fast as commercial cycle accurate modeling tools such as carbon modelstudio and arc vtoc.
