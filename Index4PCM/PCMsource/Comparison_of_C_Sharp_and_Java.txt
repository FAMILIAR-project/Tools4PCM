definition
in java, the enumeration type is a class, and its values are objects (instances) of that class. the only valid values are the ones listed in the enumeration. the enumeration type may declare fields, allowing each individual enumerated value to reference additional data associated uniquely with that specific value. the enumeration type may also declare or override methods, or even implement interfaces.
enumeration in c# are implicitly derived from the type that again is a value type derivative. the value set of a c# enumeration is defined by the underlying type that can be a signed or unsigned integer type of 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits. the enumeration definition defines names for the selected integer values and is syntactic sugar. by default the first name is assigned the value 0 (zero) and the following names are assigned in increments of 1. any value of the underlying primitive type is a valid value of the enumeration type, though an explicit cast may be needed to assign it.
combining
java enumeration set and map collections provide functionality to combine multiple enumeration values to a combined value. these special collections allows compiler optimization to minimize the overhead incurred by using collections as the combination mechanism.
c# supports bit-mapped enumerations where an actual value may be a combination of enumerated values bitwise or'ed together. the formatting and parsing methods implicitly defined by the type will attempt to use these values.

type checks and downcasts are injected into client code (the code referencing the generics). compared to non-generic code with manual casts, these casts will be the same, but compared to compile-time verified code that would not need runtime casts and checks, these operations represent a performance overhead.
c#/.net generics guarantee type-safety and are verified at compile time, making extra checks/casts are unnecessary at runtime. hence, generic code will run faster than non-generic (or type-erased) code that require casts when handling non-generic or type-erased objects.
cannot use primitive types as type parameters; instead, the developer must use the wrapper type corresponding to the primitive type. this incurs extra performance overhead by requiring boxing and unboxing conversions as well a memory and garbage collection pressure, as the wrappers will be heap-allocated as opposed to stack-allocated.
primitive and value types are allowed as type parameters in generic realizations. at runtime code will be synthesized and compiled for each unique combination of type parameters upon first use. generics that are realized with primitive/value type do not require boxing/unboxing conversions.
generic exceptions are not allowed and a type parameter cannot be used in a catch clause
can both define generic exceptions and use those in catch clauses
static members are shared across all generic realizations (during type erasure all realizations are folded into a single class)
static members are separate for each generic realization. a generic realization is a unique class.
type parameters cannot be used in declarations of static fields/methods or in definitions of static inner classes
no restrictions on use of type parameters
cannot create an array where the component type is a generic realization (concrete parameterized type)
a generic realization is a 1st class citizen and can be used as any other class; also an array component
cannot create an array where the component type is a type parameter
type parameters represent actual, discrete classes and can be used like any other type within the generic definition.
there is no class literal for a concrete realization of a generic type
a generic realization is an actual class.
is not allowed with type parameters or concrete generic realizations
the and operators work the same for type parameters as for any other type.
cannot create new instances using a type parameter as the type
with a constructor constraint, generic methods or methods of generic classes can create instances of classes that have default constructors.
type information is erased during compilation. special extensions to reflection must be used to discover the original type.
type information about c# generic types is fully preserved at runtime, and allows complete reflection support as well as instantiation of generic types.
reflection cannot be used to construct new generic realizations. during compilation extra code (typecasts) are injected into the client code of generics. this precludes creating new realizations later.
reflection can be used to create new realizations for new combinations of type parameters.

arrays are implicitly direct specializations of . they are not unified with collection types.
arrays in c# are implicit specializations of the class that implements a number of collection interfaces.
arrays and collections are completely separate with no unification. arrays cannot be passed where sequences or collections are expected
arrays can be passed where sequences (s) or collections/list interfaces are expected. however, the collection operations that alter the number of elements (insert/add/remove) will throw exceptions as these operations are not supported by arrays.
the statement accepts either arrays or s. all collections implement . this means that the same short syntax can be used in for-loops.
the statement iterates through a sequence using the or interface. because arrays always implicitly implement these interfaces, the loop will iterate through arrays as well.
in both languages arrays are covariant. this means that a array is assignable to variables of because is a specialization of (assignable to) . in both languages the arrays will perform a type check when inserting new values because type-safety would otherwise be compromised. this is in contrast to how generic collections have been implemented in both languages.

arrays can be resized while preserving existing values using the static array method.
implemented as a retrofit for the library having extra features, like data structures like sets and linked sets, and has a number of algorithms to manipulate elements of a collection, like finding the largest element based on some comparator object, finding the smallest element, finding sublists within a list, reverse the contents of a list, shuffle the contents of a list, create immutable versions of a collection, performs sorts, and make binary searches.
the c# collections framework consists of classes from the and the namespaces with a number of useful interfaces, abstract classes, and data structures. net 3.5 added namespace contains various native extension methods for querying collections, such as , , , , , , and many others. queries using these methods are called linq queries.

keyword
feature, example usage
,
in c#, statement blocks or expressions can enable run-time checking for arithmetic overflow.
,
c# implements properties as part of the language syntax with their optional corresponding and accessors, as an alternative for the accessor method used in java, which is not a language feature but a coding-pattern based on method name conventions.

c# supports the keyword. this can occasionally be useful, for example for implementing finite state machine or for generated code, but the use of a more structured method of control flow is usually recommended (see criticism of the goto statement). java does not support the statement (but is a reserved word). however, java does support labeled and statements, which in certain situations can be used when a statement might otherwise be used.

in c#, the keyword is a shorthand for synchronizing access to a block of code across threads (using a ), wrapped in a … block.
,
c# has support for output and reference parameters. these allow returning multiple output values from a method, or passing values by reference.

java uses to guarantee the results of floating point operations remain the same across platforms.

in c#, the switch statement also operates on strings and longs. fallthrough is allowed for empty statements and possible via 'goto case' for statements containing code. java's switch statement does not operate on strings (before java 7) nor primitive type but falls through for all statements (excluding those with '').

in java, the keyword is a shorthand for synchronizing access to a block of code across threads (using a ), wrapped in a … block.

java requires every method to declare the checked exceptions or superclasses of the checked exceptions that it can throw. any method can also optionally declare the unchecked exception that it throws. c# has no such syntax.

in c#, causes the method (implemented via the interface) of the object declared to be executed after the code block has run or when an exception is thrown within the code block.in java se 7 a similar construct has been added called try-with-resources :
